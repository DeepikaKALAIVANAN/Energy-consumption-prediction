**Machine Learning to Predict Energy Consumption**
This project explores how machine learning models can be applied to forecast energy consumption using real-world data. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization of predictions.

_## Models Used_

- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**

_## Features_

- Data loading and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Time-based feature engineering
- Training and evaluation of regression models
- Visualizations of predicted vs actual energy usage

_## Dataset_

The dataset used in this notebook contains time-series data related to energy consumption. It includes features such as:

- Timestamps
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Power consumption (target)

_## Evaluation Metrics_

The models are evaluated using:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- RÂ² Score
